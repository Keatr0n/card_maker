# card_maker

A super basic app that speeds up the creation of personalized birthday cards that I used to make for people in photoshop.
Originally I made this yonks ago, but I could never get it working so I just went back to adobe.
But since my new linux machine doesn't have photoshop.
I decided to dig this out of the attic and patch it up so I never have to rely on that god forsaken company.

Enjoy!
